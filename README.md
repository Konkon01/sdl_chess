# Chess Game
This is my first project using SDL2. I choose chess, because I am a fan of it.
My objective is to use the knowledges I got from university and using them to build something.
I am trying my best to do good Object Oriented Programming using the SOLID principles.
Tasks ahead:
  - Pawn movement calculation :heavy_check_mark:
  - Rook movement calculation :heavy_check_mark:
  - Bishop movement calculation :heavy_check_mark:
  - Queen movement calculation :heavy_check_mark:
  - Horse movement calculation :heavy_check_mark:
  - Does the non king piece's move expose the King?
  - King movement calculation
  - Was there check given?
    - Was it checkmate?
